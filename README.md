Our project aims to revolutionize smoking cessation by offering a comprehensive mobile app integrated with hardware to help individuals track their smoking habits, set personalized goals, and receive support on their quit journey. By leveraging real-time data insights, interactive features, and community support, we strive to empower users to break free from smoking addiction and improve their overall health and well-being.
